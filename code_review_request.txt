I have updated the portfolio to align with the user's request:
1. Updated projects in Projects.tsx:
   - Kost Sicherheitstechnik: Updated solution to reflect migration from WordPress to Cloudflare.
   - Bockel-Bartscher: Removed WordPress from stack.
   - RAG Analysis Node: Removed completely.
2. Updated index.html, Hero.tsx, Evolution.tsx, SkillMonitor.tsx, TerminalBoot.tsx, and Resume to remove WordPress and AI tools (Cline, Roo Code, Google Stitch).
3. Replaced "AI Workflow" with "Modern Workflow" or "Advanced Pipelines".
4. Ensured "Vibecoding" is replaced by "Modern Workflows" as per memory instructions.

Please review the changes for accuracy and alignment with the instructions.
